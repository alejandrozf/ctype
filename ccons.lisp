  ;; and in which all the cons types are pairwise disjoint.
  ;; But that's pretty ugly in general.
  ;; If a <: c, (and a (not c)) = nil, and (and a c) = a, so we have

  ;; which could be further reduced to
  ;; (or (cons a               (or b d))
  ;;     (cons (and (not a) c) d))
  ;; if c <: a as well (i.e. a = c), (and (not a) c) = nil, so it's just
  ;; (cons a (or b d)).
  ;; You can swap a and c, or do this with b and d, obviously.
  ;; Alternately, if a and c are disjoint, (and a c) = nil, (and a (not c)) = a,

  ;;     (cons a (and b d))

  ;; but with the understanding that they are disjoint. Not too helpful?
  ;; SO, in order of preference, if there's a type equality we can reduce
  ;; to a cons type; or if there's a subtype we can reduce to two modified
  ;; cons types; or we just make a general union.
  ;; We can also check if a <: (not c) and such, but I think at that point we
  ;; may as well actually computer intersections anyway.
  ;; We have to be careful to avoid "flipping". With the above rules,
  ;; (or (cons t (not symbol)) (cons (not symbol) symbol))
  ;; is "simplified" to (or (cons (not symbol) t) (cons symbol (not symbol)))
  ;; which in turn "simplifies" back to where it started! Very bad.
  ;; So we only do it on the cdrs (arbitrarily chosen) if we know that the
  ;; cons types are not disjoint.
